# pathnet

Code (R package?) to create PPI-style networks from pathways, using overlap between their constituent genes to define interactions/edges. This will allow for visualization of similar pathways based on their underlying genes, instead of a category/hierarchy term. One can then overlay the results of pathway enrichment analyses onto this "foundational" network, mapping dysregulation and significance onto nodes (pathways) in the network.
